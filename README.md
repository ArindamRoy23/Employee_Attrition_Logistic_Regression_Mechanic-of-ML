##### Hi, 
###### Welcome to this repository. The objective of this notebook is to best understand logistic regression with the help of the example of employee attrition predictions.

## Prologue


### About project Mechanic of Machine Learning:
I am a mechanical engineer by educaion. Now, I want to deep dive in the world of Machine Learning, hence the name, mechanic of ML :D. I have taken up this project to understand the in-depth mathematics involved in regularly used ML algorithms. Under this project, I will be sharing useful material and links as I explore this domain.The objective is to learn and spread the same. Stay tuned to my github for updates!

### Business Case: 
The goal of this notebook is to develop a risk model that forecasts the likelihood of employee attrition in a business based on historic data. 
### Notebook objectives:

* To understand and implement logistic regression 
* To visualize and understand the data
* To select features which can best predict costs based on attribute-value pair. 
* To derive conclusions from the data and suggest solutions for business.
